Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

TASK 1
=======================================================
Replace the header contents: 
- replace logo with an image of your own (100px x 100px and containing transparency). 
- replace 'Firstname Lastname' with your name
- replace 'Name of Site' with a new site name

TASK 2
=======================================================
Add your introduction to your step-by-step-guide, including a title, time required to complete the activity, and a rating of how awesome the activity is. 
** Be careful to keep all the HTML tags intact when you are changing the text.

        <div class="introduction">

          <div class="information">
            <h1>How to belay from above on a multi-pitch climb</h1>

            <hr>
            <p><b>Assembly time:</b> 5 minutes<br>
              <b>Awesome rating:</b> 98% awesome</p>
            <hr>

            <p>So here you are. Maybe you started in a gym, gained some confidence leading on single pitch routes outside, and now you're ready to jump into multi-pitch climbing. Most multi-pitch routes involves trad gear, but hopefully you start on something less committing, a simple multi-pitch sport route with two bolt anchors, and that's what this guide is about. Remember that reading and thinking about things like this only take you so far; you need to find somewhere to safely practice this system and learn your equipment. This guide doesn't include rappelling, so learn beforehand or find somwhere you can walk off.</p>

TASK 3
=======================================================
Add your Things You'll Need. 
** Be careful to keep all the HTML tags intact when you are changing the text.
-->         
            <ul class="list-of-items">

              <li>Protection-for this guide, quickdraws are sufficient. Bring a couple more than the number of bolts on each pitch, just in case.</li>
              <li>Belay device that can handle belaying from above</li>
              <li>Cordalette, for building your anchor. In this guide, I use a 25 ft cut of 7mm cordalette. Be aware, there a lot of anchor options, and you should know them well if you're going to use them.</li>
              <li>Locking carabiners. As the leader, bring at least four for this system.</li>
              <li> Personal Anchor System (PAS). While not entirely necessary, I use it for extra piece of mind, and a little more reduncancy when tying into the anchor. It also doubles as a rappel extension.</li>
              <li>Everything else you need to climb and rappel safely. Listing all of that gear would be beyond the scope of this guide. </li>

              <h3>Here you are, facing a two-bolt anchor on top of the first pitch of your climb.</h3>
              <p>Before constructing your cordalette anchors, tie yourself in with a PAS and a locking carabiner on one bolt, and a quickdraw linked to your PAS on the other bolt. You're connected to both bolts, and thus are redundant.</p>

              <h3>Now, turn your cordalette into a quad anchor.</h3>
              <p>It's easier to have your quad seup before hand, so you aren't fumbling around at the top of the pitch, tying your cordalette. First, tie the two ends of your cordalette together with a double fisherman's knot. Double your cordalette back across itself, so you have four strands of equal length. On one end, tie a figure 8 on-a-bight; you can use an overhand on-a-bight, but overhand knots tighten as a load is placed on them, so they will be harder to untie in the future. On the other end, tie another figure 8 on-a-bight. Clip each end into each bolt, using whatever carabiners are available. If you don't have enough locking carabiners, nonlocking carabiners will be just as fine.</p>

              <h3>Now you have a quad anchor attached to your two bolts, with four strands of cordalette in the middle; hence, the "quad."</h3>
              <p>Seperate the strands in the middle, and clip one locking carabiner to two of the strands, and another locking carabiner to the remaining two strands. Tie yourself into the carabiner closest to you with a clove hitch, and tie the loop of your belay device into the other locking carabiner. Belay devices that are able to belay from above, like the ATC Guide, look like a typical belay device, but with a loop on the back. Clip that loop into your anchor. Let your partner know that you are safely attached to the anchor, and ready to be taken off belay. </p>

              <h3>Now, begin pulling up rope and coiling it neatly.</h3>
              <p>You're likely not to use your entire rope length on any given pitch, especially not on a well bolted "created" pitch. That means you may have ~30 m of rope between you and your belayer. Pull the rope up and coil it until your belayer feels you tugging on them. There are a couple of ways to keep your rope neat, which I won't go in to, but always utilize a ledge if you have one. </p> 
            </div>

          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Once you have your rope pulled up and neatly coiled, you may begin belaying your partner up to you.</h3>
              <p>You should have this skill down before getting on the wall. Remember to communicate with your partner. They should tell you when they start climbing, and you should begin belaying immediately. Always double check your system; it's only you up there. Make sure the climber's strand is coming out of the back of your belay device, unobstructed all the way down to where your partner is, and the brake strand is coming out of the front, where the friction created by your device is able to be utilized to stop a fall.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>When your parter is at the top of the pitch, make sure they immediately tie themselves in to the anchor.</h3>
              <p> Now you have a couple of options. You can either lead in blocks, where you lead the next pitch, or you can swing leads, where your partner leads the next pitch. If you lead in blocks, make sure to flip the rope over, because your strand has been buried under the rest of your rope. Flipping it means your strand can more easily be fed out of those coils. If you're swinging leads, there's no need to do this, because the strand closest to your parter is already on top of the coiled rope. Whoever is leading, it's usually prescient to clip one of the bolts at the anchor as the first piece of protection, as a leader fall onto the anchor directly can create undue stress. Then, simply repeat this process at the each belay station until you're done. </p>
